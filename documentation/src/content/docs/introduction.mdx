Welcome to **Cease Nonsense**, a comprehensive ESLint plugin designed to catch common mistakes, enforce best practices,
and improve code quality in TypeScript, React, and roblox-ts projects.

## What is Cease Nonsense?

Cease Nonsense provides over 40 carefully crafted ESLint rules that go beyond standard linting. These rules are designed
to catch subtle bugs, enforce architectural patterns, and improve developer experience.

## Who is this for?

Cease Nonsense is ideal for:

- **TypeScript developers** who want stricter linting than stock ESLint provides
- **React developers** working with hooks and functional components
- **roblox-ts developers** building games and experiences on Roblox
- **Teams** who want to enforce consistent coding standards across projects

## Quick Start

<Steps>

1. **Install the package**

    <Code code="bun add -D eslint-plugin-cease-nonsense" lang="bash" title="Terminal" />

2. **Add to your ESLint config**

    <Code
    	code={[
    		"import ceaseNonsense from 'eslint-plugin-cease-nonsense';",
    		"",
    		"export default [",
    		"\tceaseNonsense.configs.recommended,",
    		"\t// ... your other configs",
    		"];",
    	].join("\n")}
    	lang="typescript"
    	title="eslint.config.ts"
    />

3. **Run ESLint**

    <Code code="bun run eslint ." lang="bash" title="Terminal" />

</Steps>

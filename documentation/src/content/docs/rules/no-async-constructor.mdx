Don't do async work in constructors.

## Rule Details :badge[Safety]{variant=danger}

Constructors can't be `async`. If you kick off async work in a constructor (via `then()` or an internal async wrapper),
callers can use the instance before it's initialized. That's a race condition waiting to happen.

<Aside type="danger" title="Architectural Risk">
	Keep constructors synchronous. If you need async initialization, use a static factory.
</Aside>

## Refactoring Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Identify Async Work**
   Locate `this.init().then(...)` or other async callbacks inside your constructor.
2. **Private Constructor** Make the constructor `private` or `protected` to prevent external unsafe instantiation.
3. **Create Static Factory** Define a `static async create(...)` method that performs the initialization logic.
4. **Return Instance** Construct the object inside the factory, `await` its async needs, and return the finished result.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Async in Constructor
		Bans patterns that leave the object in a "loading" state after construction.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"class Database {",
    			"\tconstructor() {",
    			"\t\t// ❌ Dangerous async side-effect",
    			"\t\tthis.connect().then(() => print(\"Connected\"));",
    			"\t}",
    			"",
    			"\tasync connect() { ... }",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Static Factory Method
    	Use a dedicated async method to handle setup and return the instance.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"class Database {",
    			"\tprivate constructor() {",
    			"\t\t// Initialize sync properties only",
    			"\t}",
    			"",
    			"\tstatic async create() {",
    			"\t\tconst db = new Database();",
    			"\t\tawait db.connect();",
    			"\t\treturn db;",
    			"\t}",
    			"}",
    			"",
    			"// Usage",
    			"const db = await Database.create();",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

## Why avoid async constructors?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Race Conditions" icon="bolt">
		Methods may be called on the instance before the `then()` callback has finished setup.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Error Handling" icon="warning">
		Errors in async constructor tasks are difficult to catch and can crash the whole process.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Predictability" icon="rocket">
		The Static Factory pattern makes it clear that initialization is an asynchronous, fallible process.

Detects instance methods that don't use `this`.

## Rule Details :badge[Performance]{variant=success}

In `roblox-ts`, instance methods carry significant metatable overhead. If a method doesn't access any instance state
(via `this`), it should be extracted as a standalone function. This reduces memory usage and improves lookup speed for
every instance of the class in the Roblox engine.

<Aside type="danger" title="Metatable Overhead">
	Each instance method in a class increases the size of the metatable. In games with thousands of instances, this
	overhead compounds, impacting both per-frame performance and total memory.
</Aside>

## Refactoring Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Identify Stateless Methods**
   The linter identifies methods with no `this` references in their bodies.

2. **Extract to Module Scope** Move the method body outside the class definition to the top-level or a utility file.

3. **Convert to Pure Function** Ensure all dependencies are passed as explicit parameters rather than being implied by
   object membership.

4. **Update Call Sites** Replace `this.myMethod()` calls with a direct module-level call: `myMethod()`.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Bound Pure Functions
		Bans instance methods that act as pure functions but are tied to class instances.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"class MathSystem {",
    			"\t// ❌ Doesn't use 'this', but costs metatable space",
    			"\tprivate calculate(x: number): number {",
    			"\t\treturn x * x;",
    			"\t}",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Standalone Utils
    	Extract stateless logic to module scope for maximum performance.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function calculate(x: number) {",
    			"\treturn x * x;",
    			"}",
    			"",
    			"class MathSystem {",
    			"\tpublic run(val: number) {",
    			"\t\treturn calculate(val);",
    			"\t}",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

## Why is this important?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Lookup Speed" icon="bolt">
		Module-level functions are resolved faster than methods that require Lua index traversal.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Memory Scale" icon="list-format">
		Removing 5 methods from a class with 1,000 instances significantly reduces heap fragmentation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Testability" icon="rocket">
		Pure standalone functions can be tested without the overhead of instantiating whole classes.

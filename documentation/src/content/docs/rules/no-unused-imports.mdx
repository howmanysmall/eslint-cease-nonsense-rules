import { Aside, Code, LinkCard, CardGrid, Card, Tabs, TabItem, Badge, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Reports imports you don't actually use.

## Rule Details :badge[Maintenance]{variant=note}

Reports when an import is defined but never referenced. Unused imports add noise at the top of the file and make it
harder to see what a module depends on. The rule also counts references inside JSDoc tags.

<Aside type="note" title="JSDoc Support">
	Some imports only exist for JSDoc tags like `@see` or `@link`. This rule counts those so you don't delete them by
	accident.
</Aside>

## Cleanup Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Find unused imports**
   The linter flags import statements with no references in code or JSDoc.

2. **Check for Intentional Side-Effects** Rarely, an import is needed only for its side-effects (e.g.,
   `import "./init"`). If so, use the bare import syntax without binding variables.

3. **Delete the Reference** Remove the specific named import or the entire import line.

4. **Check dependencies** Sometimes this reveals a package you can remove.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Ghost Imports
		Bans imports that don't contribute to the logic or documentation of the file.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			'import { unusedFunction, UsedFunction } from "./utils";',
    			'import { AnotherUnused } from "./types";',
    			"",
    			"UsedFunction();",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Lean Imports
    	Every import line corresponds to an active symbol in the file.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			'import { usedFunction } from "./utils";',
    			"",
    			"/**",
    			" * @see {anotherUsedFunction} ✅ Counted as used",
    			" */",
    			'import { anotherUsedFunction } from "./more-utils";',
    			"",
    			"usedFunction();",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

## Why remove unused imports?

	<Card title="Code Clarity" icon="list-format">
		Reduces mental noise when opening a file; you only see what the module actually needs.

	<Card title="Build Speed" icon="bolt">
		Minimizes the number of files a bundler or compiler has to parse and analyze during a build.

	<Card title="Dependency Health" icon="rocket">
		Helps you identify when a feature is truly removed and its library can be uninstalled.

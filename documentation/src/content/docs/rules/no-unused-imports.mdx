import { Aside, Code, LinkCard, CardGrid, Card, Tabs, TabItem, Badge, Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Disallow unused imports to keep your codebase clean.

## Rule Details :badge[Maintenance]{variant=note}

This rule reports when an import is defined but never used in the code. Unused imports clutter the top of your files,
increase build times (slightly), and make it harder to see what a module actually depends on. This rule is enhanced with
scope analysis to detect usage even within JSDoc comments.

<Aside type="note" title="JSDoc Support">
	Unlike the standard `no-unused-vars` rule, this one can check if an import is used within a JSDoc comment (e.g.,
	`@see`, `@link`), preventing accidental deletion of symbols used only for documentation.
</Aside>

## Cleanup Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Identify Unused Links**
   The linter flags import statements that have no references in your file's logic or JSDoc.

2. **Check for Intentional Side-Effects** Rarely, an import is needed only for its side-effects (e.g.,
   `import "./init"`). If so, use the bare import syntax without binding variables.

3. **Delete the Reference** Remove the specific named import or the entire import line.

4. **Verify Dependencies** Running this cleanup often reveals nested packages that are no longer needed at the
   `package.json` level.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Ghost Imports
		Bans imports that don't contribute to the logic or documentation of the file.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			'import { unusedFunction, UsedFunction } from "./utils";',
    			'import { AnotherUnused } from "./types";',
    			"",
    			"UsedFunction();",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Lean Imports
    	Every import line corresponds to an active symbol in the file.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			'import { usedFunction } from "./utils";',
    			"",
    			"/**",
    			" * @see {anotherUsedFunction} ✅ Counted as used",
    			" */",
    			'import { anotherUsedFunction } from "./more-utils";',
    			"",
    			"usedFunction();",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

## Why remove unused imports?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Code Clarity" icon="list-format">
		Reduces mental noise when opening a file; you only see what the module actually needs.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Build Speed" icon="bolt">
		Minimizes the number of files a bundler or compiler has to parse and analyze during a build.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Dependency Health" icon="rocket">
		Helps you identify when a feature is truly removed and its library can be uninstalled.

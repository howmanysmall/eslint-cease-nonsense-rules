Reports React components that are doing too much in one place.

## Rule Details :badge[Complex]{variant=danger}

A "god component" tries to own an entire screen: state, data, rendering, and every edge case. This rule puts hard
limits on a few signals (line count, TSX nesting, and stateful hooks). If you trip them, split the component into
smaller pieces with clearer responsibilities.

<Aside type="caution" title="Complexity Signals">
	Deeply nested TSX, lots of local state, and components that run for hundreds of lines are usually telling you the same
	thing: split it.
</Aside>

## Refactoring Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Pick the main job**
   Decide what the component is responsible for. Everything else moves out.
2. **Extract logic** Move state management, data fetching, and event handlers into `use*` hooks.
3. **Split the UI** Pull independent sections (header, list, sidebar) into sub-components.
4. **Flatten TSX** If you have more than 3 levels of nesting, extract the inner block into its own component.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Bloated Components
		Bans components that try to own an entire screen's worth of logic and UI.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function MassiveDashboard() {",
    			"  const [user, setUser] = useState();",
    			"  const [theme, setTheme] = useState();",
    			"  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);",
    			"  const [data, setData] = useState();",
    			"  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');",
    			"  const [sort, setSort] = useState('asc'); // 7th state hook!",
    			"",
    			"  return (",
    			"    <div>",
    			"      <header>...</header>",
    			"      <aside>...</aside>",
    			"      <main>...",
    			"        <section>...",
    			"          <div>{/* This is too deep! */}</div>",
    			"        </section>",
    			"      </main>",
    			"    </div>",
    			"  );",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Composed Dashboard
		Split the screen into small, focused pieces you can test.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function Dashboard() {",
    			"  const { user, notifications } = useDashboardData();",
    			"  const { filter, sort, setFilter, setSort } = useDashboardFilters();",
    			"",
    			"  return (",
    			"    <Layout>",
    			"      <Header user={user} />",
    			"      <MainContent ",
    			"        data={notifications} ",
    			"        filters={{ filter, sort }} ",
    			"      />",
    			"    </Layout>",
    			"  );",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"

	<Card title="Line Count" icon="list-format">
		Hard limit: 200 lines. Aim for under 120.

	<Card title="TSX Nesting" icon="magnifier">
		Max depth: 3. If it goes deeper, extract a component.
	</Card>
	<Card title="State Hooks" icon="bolt">
		Max 5 stateful hooks. More usually wants a reducer or custom hook.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Explicit Undefined" icon="warning">
		Prefer `undefined` over `null` to keep types simple.

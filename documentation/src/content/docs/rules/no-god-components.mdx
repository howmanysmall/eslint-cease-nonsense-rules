Flags React components that are too large or complex.

## Rule Details :badge[Complex]{variant=danger}

A "God Component" is one that does too much, knows too much, and is a nightmare to test or maintain. This rule enforces
component size and complexity limits based on a strict checklist. If a component exceeds these limits, it's a strong
signal that you should split it into smaller, logically isolated pieces.

<Aside type="caution" title="Complexity Signals">
	Deeply nested JSX, dozens of separate `useState` hooks, and components spanning hundreds of lines are warning signs
	of poor architectural health.
</Aside>

## Refactoring Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Identify the Core Concern**
   Determine the primary responsibility of the component. Anything not strictly related should be moved.
2. **Extract Logic to Hooks** Move state management, API calls, and complex event handlers into custom `use*` hooks.
3. **Slice the UI** Identify independent UI sections (Headers, Lists, Sidebars) and extract them into sub-components.
4. **Flatten JSX** If you have more than 3 levels of nesting, extract the inner levels into a dedicated component.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Bloated Components
		Bans components that attempt to manage an entire screen's worth of logic and UI.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function MassiveDashboard() {",
    			"  const [user, setUser] = useState();",
    			"  const [theme, setTheme] = useState();",
    			"  const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState([]);",
    			"  const [data, setData] = useState();",
    			"  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('');",
    			"  const [sort, setSort] = useState('asc'); // 7th state hook!",
    			"",
    			"  return (",
    			"    <div>",
    			"      <header>...</header>",
    			"      <aside>...</aside>",
    			"      <main>...",
    			"        <section>...",
    			"          <div>{/* This is too deep! */}</div>",
    			"        </section>",
    			"      </main>",
    			"    </div>",
    			"  );",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Composed Dashboard
    	Break the screen into tiny, focused, and testable units.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function Dashboard() {",
    			"  const { user, notifications } = useDashboardData();",
    			"  const { filter, sort, setFilter, setSort } = useDashboardFilters();",
    			"",
    			"  return (",
    			"    <Layout>",
    			"      <Header user={user} />",
    			"      <MainContent ",
    			"        data={notifications} ",
    			"        filters={{ filter, sort }} ",
    			"      />",
    			"    </Layout>",
    			"  );",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Complexity Metrics

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Line Count" icon="list-format">
		Hard limit of 200 lines. Components should ideally stay under 120 lines.
	</Card>
	<Card title="TSX Nesting" icon="magnifier">
		Max depth of 3. Deeply nested HTML belongs in a sub-component.
	</Card>
	<Card title="State Hooks" icon="bolt">
		Max 5 stateful hooks (`useState`, etc.). More suggests a need for a Reducer or Custom Hook.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Explicit Undefined" icon="warning">
		Bans `null` literals in favor of `undefined` to keep types clean and idiomatic.

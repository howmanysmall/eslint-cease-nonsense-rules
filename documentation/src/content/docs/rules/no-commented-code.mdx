Reports commented-out code blocks.

## Rule Details :badge[Maintenance]{variant=note}

Commented-out code clutters the codebase and gets stale fast. This rule looks for comments that are really code, while
trying to ignore real documentation and explanatory notes.

<Aside type="tip" title="Trust Version Control">
	Delete it. Git has it. If the old behavior matters, write down why in a ticket or a short comment.
</Aside>

## Cleanup Path

<Steps>
1. **Identify violations**
   The linter flags comment blocks that look like valid JavaScript/TypeScript.
2. **Decide what you actually want** If the behavior matters later, move it to a task description.
3. **Delete the block** Remove the commented lines.
4. **Keep the reasoning** If the comment was trying to explain a decision, rewrite it as a short "why" comment.

{/* oxfmt-ignore */}

</Steps>

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Commented Code
		Bans blocks of code that have been neutralized with `//` or `/* */`.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function calculate(x: number) {",
    			"\t// const result = x * 2;",
    			"\t// return result;",
    			"",
    			"\treturn x + 1;",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Explanatory Comments
    	Use comments to explain things that the code cannot say for itself.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function calculate(x: number) {",
    			"\t// TODO: Consider multiplying by 2 once API is ready",
    			"\t// Use a simple offset for now to avoid overflow",
    			"\treturn x + 1;",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Detection Strategy

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Keyword Matching" icon="list-format">
		Looks for common syntax tokens like `function`, `class`, `import`, and `const` inside comments.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Parse Pass" icon="bolt">
		Briefly attempts to parse the comment content; if it's valid syntax, it's flagged as code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Exclusion Logic" icon="setting">
		Automatically ignores URLs, JSDoc tags, and common English phrases to reduce false positives.
	</Card>

Detects and reports commented-out code blocks.

## Rule Details :badge[Maintenance]{variant=note}

Commented-out code clutters the codebase, causes confusion, and suggests a lack of confidence in your version control
system. This rule uses heuristic detection combined with parsing to identify commented code while distinguishing it from
actual documentation or explanatory comments.

<Aside type="tip" title="Trust Version Control">
	Don't be afraid to delete code! If you ever need it back, you can find it in your Git history. Commented code often
	becomes stale and misleading within weeks.
</Aside>

## Cleanup Path

<Steps>
1. **Identify Violations**
   The linter will flag blocks of comments that look like valid JavaScript or TypeScript (e.g., lines containing `const`, `if`, or `() =>`).
2. **Evaluate Importance** If the code is genuinely valuable for the future, move it to a task description or a feature
   request document.
3. **Delete the Block** Literally just delete the commented lines.
4. **Add Context (Optional)** If the comment was meant to explain a complex decision, rewrite it as a "Why" comment rather than keeping the old code.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Commented Code
		Bans blocks of code that have been neutralized with `//` or `/* */`.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function calculate(x: number) {",
    			"\t// const result = x * 2;",
    			"\t// return result;",
    			"",
    			"\treturn x + 1;",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Explanatory Comments
    	Use comments to explain things that the code cannot say for itself.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"function calculate(x: number) {",
    			"\t// TODO: Consider multiplying by 2 once API is ready",
    			"\t// Use a simple offset for now to avoid overflow",
    			"\treturn x + 1;",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Detection Strategy

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Keyword Matching" icon="list-format">
		Looks for common syntax tokens like `function`, `class`, `import`, and `const` inside comments.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Parse Pass" icon="bolt">
		Briefly attempts to parse the comment content; if it's valid syntax, it's flagged as code.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Exclusion Logic" icon="setting">
		Automatically ignores URLs, JSDoc tags, and common English phrases to reduce false positives.

Prevent reaching into sibling component folders for nested modules.

## Rule Details :badge[Maintenance]{variant=caution}

Components should be isolated units. Reaching into the internal folders (like `utils`, `hooks`, or `styles`) of a sibling component creates tight coupling and makes refactoring brittle. This rule enforces that components only interact with their siblings via a public API (typically an `index.ts` file).

<Aside type="caution" title="Tight Coupling">
	If you change the internal folder structure of `ComponentA`, you shouldn't have to fix imports in `ComponentB`.
	Strict boundaries ensure internal changes stay internal.
</Aside>

## Refactoring Path

<Steps>
1. **Define Public API**
   Ensure every component folder has an `index.ts` that exports only the public-facing elements.

2. **Audit Cross-Imports**
   Locate imports that look like `../OtherComponent/internal/helper`.

3. **Expose or Move**
    - If the helper is truly specific to `OtherComponent`, expose it in its `index.ts`.
    - If the helper is generally useful, move it to a shared `src/utils` folder.

4. **Update Imports**
   Replace deep imports with clean, top-level imports: `import { helper } from "../OtherComponent"`.

## Examples

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="❌ Incorrect" icon="close">
		### Deep Sibling Imports
		Bans reaching past the component's root into its subfolders.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"// Reaching into another component's internals",
    			'import { helper } from "../OtherComponent/utils/helper";',
    			"",
    			"// Importing from sibling's nested hooks",
    			'import { hook } from "../UserProfile/hooks/useProfile";',
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Public API & Shared Utils
    	Interact through interfaces or move shared logic to a central location.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"// Import from shared location",
    			'import { helper } from "../../shared/utils/helper";',
    			"",
    			"// Index import from sibling component (Public API)",
    			'import { OtherComponent } from "../OtherComponent";',
    			"",
    			"// Internal imports are allowed within the same component",
    			'import { myLocalHelper } from "./utils/myLocalHelper";',
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

## Why Enforce Boundaries?

		Hides internal implementation details, allowing you to refactor components safely.

	<Card title="No Cycles" icon="bolt">
		Reduces the risk of circular dependencies by encouraging a tree-like import structure.

	<Card title="Reusability" icon="rocket">
		Makes components easier to extract or move because they have zero hidden dependencies.

## Recommended Structure

<Code
	code={[
		"components/",
		"  UserProfile/",
		"    index.ts                 # Public API (exports only what is needed)",
		"    UserProfile.tsx          # Main component",
		"    hooks/                   # Internal hooks (NOT for sibling use)",
		"      useUserData.ts",
		"    utils/                   # Internal utilities",
		"      formatters.ts",
	].join("\n")}

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Enforce that React component props are typed as read-only.

## Rule Details

This rule ensures that React component props are marked as `readonly` in TypeScript, preventing accidental mutation of props.

## Options

This rule has no options.

## Examples

### ❌ Incorrect

<Code
	code={[
		"interface Props {",
		"\tname: string;",
		"\tage: number;",
		"}",
		"",
		"function Component({ name, age }: Props) {",
		"\t// ...",
		"}",
	].join("\n")}
	lang="typescript"
	key="interface-props-ranwb3"
/>

### ✅ Correct

<Code
	code={[
		"interface Props {",
		"\treadonly name: string;",
		"\treadonly age: number;",
		"}",
		"",
		"function Component({ name, age }: Props) {",
		"\t// ...",
		"}",
	].join("\n")}
	lang="typescript"
	key="interface-props-l1rb0i"
/>

## When Not To Use It

If you intentionally mutate props in your components (not recommended but sometimes necessary for performance), disable this rule.

## Performance

This rule is optimized with:

- Direct AST pattern matching (no global component analysis)
- Component detection caching
- Focused on common React component patterns

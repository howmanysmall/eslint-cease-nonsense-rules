Enforce that React component props are typed as read-only.

## Rule Details :badge[Safety]{variant=success}

React props should be treated as immutable. Mutating props directly can lead to unpredictable behavior, difficult-to-debug UI bugs, and performance regressions. This rule ensures that all component prop interfaces are marked with the `readonly` modifier in TypeScript.

<Aside type="important" title="Immutability">
	React's reconciliation process relies on the assumption that props do not change within a render cycle. Enforcing
	`readonly` at the type level prevents bugs before they reach the runtime.
</Aside>

## Refactoring Steps

<Steps>
1. **Identify Prop Types**
   Find `interface` or `type` definitions used for React component props.

2. **Add Readonly**
   Prefix every property in the interface with the `readonly` keyword.

3. **Check Usage**
   Ensure your component code does not attempt to assign to these props (e.g., `props.name = "New Name"`).

4. **Verify Interfaces**
   If you extend other interfaces, ensure those are also immutable or use `Readonly<T>` for the intersection.

## Examples

		### Mutable Props
		Bans prop definitions that allow re-assignment.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"interface ButtonProps {",
    			"\tlabel: string;",
    			"\tonClick: () => void;",
    			"}",
    			"",
    			"function Button({ label }: ButtonProps) {",
    			"\treturn <textbutton Text={label} />;",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="✅ Correct" icon="check">
    	### Read-Only Props
    	Use the `readonly` modifier for every property in your interface.

    	<Code
    		code={[
    			"interface ButtonProps {",
    			"\treadonly label: string;",
    			"\treadonly onClick: () => void;",
    			"}",
    			"",
    			"function Button({ label }: ButtonProps) {",
    			"\treturn <textbutton Text={label} />;",
    			"}",
    		].join("\n")}
    		lang="tsx"
    	/>
    </TabItem>

## Why Enforce This?

	<Card title="Bug Prevention" icon="bolt">
		Prevents developers from accidentally overwriting props within the component body.

	<Card title="Documentation" icon="list-format">
		Clearly signals to other developers that these values are strictly inputs and should not be modified.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Performance" icon="rocket">
		Immutability makes it safer to use optimizations like `React.memo` as you can trust prop references.
